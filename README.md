## Summary
First off, it is important to note that Des Moines, Iowa and New York City are very different cities, both in city layout, popularity for tourist destination, as well as overall workforce population. Therefore, it is hard to utilize an analysis on New York City, to attempt to persuade investors on implementing this bike share program in a non-comparable location. With that being said, one advantage Des Moines does have, over New York, is the lack of a metro system. This may increase the need for easy, fast, and reliable transportation around the downtown area. 

Now, looking into the analysis, we can see on the first image of popular starting locations. These locations tend to be around highly sought after locations, such as near Grand Central Station, Hudson Ferry Terminal, Financial District, South Central Park Enterance, etc. Therefore, it is important when designing the layout of stations, to take into account highly trafficed areas within the city in order to install bike stations. From the most popular travel times during the weekdays, we can see that most users are those that are traveling to and from the workplace, most likely. Especially since the most frequent usage times are 8-9 AM and 5-6 PM, pre- and post-work day. This also becomes important when deciding where to place bike stations, since the most frequent users where those traveling to and from work, strategically placing stations near popular offices would be ideal. In addition, when looking at the duration of travel times, we see that most travel times are 5-15 minutes. Therefore, keeping stations within a 10 minute ride from one another, will allow for optimal placement of stations for ease of checking bikes back in as close to destination as possible.
